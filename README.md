# Micro-dosing
DecLaRe project is co-experimenting with farmers in the Savannah and Northern region of Northern Ghana in 3 communities (Busunu, Tilape and Pond-Tamale) NPK microdosing in an agroforestry system of maize and shea tree. 
The decision is to assess the farm economic benefit of micro-dosing in a system of maize and shea tree. 
Considering the status quo this decision comes with 4 alternatives: 
1. Maize monoculture (status quo)
2. Maize + Shea tree (status quo)
3. Maize monoculture+ NPK microdosing
5. Maize + shea tree + NPK microdosing

The bright colors in the conceptual model mean that those variables will be switching on and off depending on which alternative we are considering in the NPV

Here we are assuming 2 status quo because other than microdosing NPK, the DecLaRe project wants to also see the benefit of having shea tree in the system (testing maize yield away and under the canopy).
